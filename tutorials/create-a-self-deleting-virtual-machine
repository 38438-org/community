# Create a Self-Deleting Virtual Machine on Google Compute Engine

Learning to use Google Cloud is best done hands-on, by actually creating, using,
and removing resources. But a common problem with doing this is learners may
forget to clean up their resources when finished trying something, resulting
in continuing running resources, often at a cost.

This tutorial shows how to create Compute Engine instances (virtual machines)
that will automatically delete themselves after a set time, insuring that
those resources will not remain, and incur charges, indefinitely even
if the learner forgets to clean them up. This will be particularly useful
in class settings.

## Objectives

Learn how to create Cloud Engine instances that will delete themselves after
a set period of time. You will see two ways to do this.

* Using the cloud console
* Using the `gcloud` CLI tool

## Before you begin

Create a Google Cloud Platform project in a web browser and note the
_Project ID_. You will use that in the steps below.

## Costs

This tutorial has you create a Compute Engine instance. That instance
will incur charges as long as it exists. Your account can use one free
micro instance (the kind created in this tutorial) as part of the
[Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free).

## Preparation

## Using the console

## Using the command line

## Cleaning up
