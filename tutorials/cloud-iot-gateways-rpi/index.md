# Test

This tutorial shows how to setup and use gateways on Cloud IoT Core. A gateway
is a device that connects less capable devices to Cloud IoT Core and performs
several tasks on the device's behalf, such as communication, authentication, 
storage, and processing

## Objectives

Test

## Before you begin

This tutorial assumes you have a Cloud Platform account and have completed the
[getting started guide](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/getting-started),
including enabling the Cloud IoT Core API. For quick cleanup, it is recommended
that you create a new GCP project that you use for this tutorial only.

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Cloud Platform, including:

* Cloud IoT Core
* Cloud Pub/Sub

Use the [pricing calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/#id=411d8ca1-210f-4f2c-babd-34c6af2b5538)
to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage. New Cloud Platform users might be
eligible for a [free trial](https://cloud.google.com/free-trial).
